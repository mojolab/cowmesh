While working with different kind of peer driven communication networks we realized that we need more tools that 
enable cross platform and corss network meshing. 

This toolset strives to collate tools that enale such cross network sharing. 

We assume two additional layers to the traditional seven in the OSI model, i.e. the peer layer and the user layer that go on either side of the application layer.
